Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of website traffic data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand user behavior, engagement metrics, and traffic patterns.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

Data Import and Initial Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and initial exploration is performed to understand its structure.

Data Cleaning and Validation: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries and initial insights are derived from the cleaned data.

Visualization: Various plots are created to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains website traffic metrics, including:

channel_group: The primary channel group driving traffic (e.g., Direct, Organic Social).

date_hour: The date and hour of the recorded metrics (YYYYMMDDHH format).

users: Number of users.

sessions: Number of sessions.

engaged_sessions: Number of engaged sessions.

avg_engagement_time_per_session: Average engagement time per session.

engaged_sessions_per_user: Engaged sessions per user.

events_per_session: Events per session.

engagement_rate: Engagement rate.

event_count: Total event count.

Key Steps in the Analysis
1. Data Import and Initial Exploration
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

Initial exploration includes displaying the first few rows and checking data types.

2. Data Cleaning and Validation
Unnamed columns are dropped.

Column names are standardized for clarity.

Data types are converted (e.g., date_hour to datetime, numeric columns to appropriate types).

A new column Hours is created to extract the hour from the timestamp.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics are generated to understand the distribution of metrics.

Missing values and outliers are identified and handled.

4. Visualization (Planned)
Time Series Analysis: Plotting user sessions and engagement over time.

Channel Performance: Comparing traffic and engagement across different channels.

Engagement Metrics: Visualizing average engagement time and engagement rate.

Hourly Trends: Analyzing traffic patterns by hour of the day.

Visualizations
The following visualizations will be created to provide insights:

Line Plot: Hourly trends in user sessions and engagement.

Bar Plot: Comparison of traffic sources (channel groups).

Histogram: Distribution of engagement metrics.

Scatter Plot: Relationship between sessions and engagement rate.

Box Plot: Identifying outliers in engagement metrics.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Usage
Clone the repository.

Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Jupyter notebook Project_code.ipynb to execute the analysis.

Expected Outcomes
Identification of high-performing traffic channels.

Insights into peak engagement times.

Understanding of user behavior and session quality.

Recommendations for optimizing website performance based on data-driven insights.

Future Work
Incorporate real-time data feeds for dynamic analysis.

Implement machine learning models to predict user engagement.

Expand the analysis to include additional metrics like conversion rates.
