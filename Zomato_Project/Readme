# Analysis of Zomato Restaurant Data by Pritam Nagar

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook by Pritam Nagar presents an exploratory data analysis of Zomato restaurant data, focusing on features like ratings, city-wise distributions, and cuisine trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.

## Key Findings

### Data Cleaning
1. The dataset contains 148 entries with 7 columns:
   - Restaurant name
   - Online order availability
   - Table booking availability
   - Rating
   - Number of votes
   - Approximate cost for two people
   - Restaurant type (Buffet/Dining)

2. The 'rate' column was converted from string format (e.g., "4.1/5") to float values.

3. No null values were found in the dataset after cleaning.

### Data Visualization
1. **Restaurant Type Distribution**:
   - The majority of restaurants fall into the "Dining" category
   - Dining restaurants are preferred by a larger number of individuals compared to Buffet restaurants

2. **Numerical Features**:
   - The average rating is around 3.8/5
   - Votes range from 0 to 4884, with a mean of ~265
   - Approximate cost for two people ranges from ₹100 to ₹950, averaging ₹418

## Notable Observations
1. The author demonstrates good data cleaning practices by:
   - Converting the rating column to numerical format
   - Checking for null values
   - Examining data types

2. The visualization focuses on understanding the distribution of restaurant types, which is valuable for business insights.

3. The analysis could be enhanced by:
   - Exploring relationships between variables (e.g., rating vs. cost)
   - Analyzing the online_order and book_table features
   - Including more visualizations of numerical features

## Conclusion
Pritam Nagar's analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding the Zomato restaurant dataset. The work shows proper data cleaning techniques and initial exploration of the data through visualization. The notebook could be expanded with more detailed analysis of relationships between variables and additional visualizations.
